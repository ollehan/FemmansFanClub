Individual Reflection
Week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better?
* I want to learn more about how to work with SCRUM and how it can help us with our project process.
  I also have never used GitHub and all its tools before and therefore it will be challenging and interesting 
  to see how GitHub can help with making our project process more organized.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* At this time we all have the same basic knowledge of SCRUM and programming and therefore it can be hard to learn someone something new.
  Therefore we can help eachother by discussing the information we received at the lectures. But as the project proceeds it is important to share newfound knowledge that could help the group.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
*Since we are in an early stage of the project we have not been through a sprint but I will contribute by learning more about scrum through lectures, discussions and litterature.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
*Since we are in an early stage of the project my learning objective will be to get all scrum knowledge neccesary to use the concept once we start with the project.
