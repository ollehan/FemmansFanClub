Individual Reflection
Week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better?
* I want to learn more about how to work with SCRUM and how it can help us with our project process.
  I also have never used GitHub and all its tools before and therefore it will be challenging and interesting 
  to see how GitHub can help with making our project process more organized.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* At this time we all have the same basic knowledge of SCRUM and programming and therefore it can be hard to learn someone something new.
  Therefore we can help eachother by discussing the information we received at the lectures. But as the project proceeds it is important to share newfound knowledge that could help the group.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
*Since we are in an early stage of the project we have not been through a sprint but I will contribute by learning more about scrum through lectures, discussions and litterature.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
*Since we are in an early stage of the project my learning objective will be to get all scrum knowledge neccesary to use the concept once we start with the project.

Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?
* I still want to learn more about how to work with SCRUM and how it can help us with our project process.
  I also want to learn more about our project and our upcoming tasks dealing with the product owners demand.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* We are still in an early stage of the project and we all have similar knowledge of SCRUM and programming.
  Therefore we can help eachother by discussing alot about things we have a hard time understanding with the project and the scrum methodology.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
*Since we are stil in an early stage of the project we have not been through a sprint but I will contribute by learning more about the project and scrum through lectures, discussions and litterature.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
*My learning objective will be to learn more about scrum and how we are able to apply this concept once starting with the project.

Week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better?
* I would like to understand how to write the user stories better and more about the product and sprint backlog.
  I also want to learn how the setup of the programming environment works and how we will work with all the functions of it.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* I can help the team by sharing what I have learned in class to the ones who could not be there.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
*  I have been trying to learn about the programming environment.
   I also have read about scrum and believe that I understand it very well.
* By attending the class this Wednesday I learned more about the project.

*My learning objective will be to learn more about the programming environment and javascript which is a language that we have not worked with before.

Week 4

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Jag skulle vilja lära mig mer om hur den befintliga appkoden är uppbyggd, vart man hittar de olika funktionerna,
hur de olika funktionerna sitter ihop mm för att ha en bred grund när vi ska utveckla appen vidare. Det hade också varit
värdefullt att lära sig mer om hur git fungerar. Jag vill även lära mig om hur man programmerar i javascript och hur det skiljer sig från java.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Vi kommer som grupp behöva dela med oss om våra nyfunna kunskaper med varandra för att få till alla de önskade funktionerna på appen
då vi inte har mycket programmeringskunskaper sedan innan.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Vi har utförligt skrivit ner alla våra epics och user stories i projektet och stämt av dessa med produktägaren
och slutanvändaren för att korrigera om vi missuppfattat någon önskad funktion. Vi har även gjort en konceptuell modell 
så att produktägaren och slutanvändaren skulle kunna visualisera våra förslag.

Veckan har handlat mycket om att få igång programmeringsmiljön så att alla har möjlighet att börja koda. Det har varit mycket strul
men vi har fått hjälp på lektionerna vilket har gjort att 7/8 datorer har fått ner alla program och fått dem att fungera. 
Min fungerar fortfarande inte men vi har beslutat att vi ska koda parvis och är inte i behov av min. Nästa vecka vill jag få en full
förståelse för appkodens alla funktioner. För att få det kommer jag behöva lägga ner mycket tid på att kolla runt i de olika klasserna och googla när jag inte förstår eller fråga gruppmedlemmarna.
