WEEK 5

WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
Thid week I have spent the time mostly on learning about Java-Script and trying to create something new with the app. This
has been much harder than I expected and it has taken more time than I planned. Therefore I want to continute improving my knowledge in
Java-script and also gain a better understanding of how the current app are made up. To do this I will spend time with the app and the 
source code but I also think that this will continute to grow meanwhile we are coding and creating the new features on the app
that the product owner and the end-user wants.
Further, I will continue to improve my knowledge in Scrum and the methodlogies. I will do this by continuing my studies of the
course litterature. I have also found some great videos that explain more about Scrum and how this can help us. I think this
is a great way to, in a relatively easy and relaxed way, gain a better grip about the "scrum way". In the group we have realized that
we have used some of the techniques and concepts from Scrum in our work with the Bacehelor theses and this was a pretty surprisingly
discovery for most of us since we have thought it was really hard to learn how to use Scrum in the beginning but now we are feeling that
it is pretty natural to use it and that some of the concepts really can be valuable in other contexts as well and this is something I
will take with me from the course.

HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
Since this week mostly has consisted of elaborating and learning about the coding part of the app, my improvements has been in this area
and it is also there I think that I may help some persons in the team to improve their knowledge. However, since it has been a week
with holidays and much time spent on our bachelor thesis, a reflection for this week will be that I have not actualy learnt so much
that I can pass on to someone else, except the learning of how hard it is to really set a good goal and to get a grip of how much
you can really do in a week. And especially that it is even harder to estimat this while you are stressed about all the things that "the
team" have not had time to do since earlier.

WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
My contribution towards the Teams applications of Scrum this week has mostly been that I have tried to keep the group on track with
the processes and trying to really get us to use all the important element(sprint planning, reflections, Daily Scrum etc.). But as I
have mentioned earlier, it has been a really "short week" and our work has not been on top. However, for next week I will try to
continue pursuing the improvement and development of the application of Scrum within my team.

WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES? 
THAT MEANS THAT FOR THE PERSONAL LEARNING OBJECTIVE YOU WILL EACH WEEK WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED IN 
RELATION TO LAST WEEK'S AMBITION (TECHNOLOGIES, CONCEPTS AND  SKILLS LEARNT AS WELL AS HOW THIS WAS ACHIEVED),
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE FOR THE NEXT WEEK AND HOW TO MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN. 
ANT TO CONTRIBUTE WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT, AND ALSO TO SHARE MY IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SCRUM

My contribution this week has mostly consisted of continuing my learning about the software development enviroment and the 
app and how you can use the Java-Script to create new features and functions in it. It feels good that I finally have succeeded in
installing all the required software and also that I have learnt how to use Expo togheter with GIT and the android studio.
I have also learnt about how to use version manager withing GitHub and how to use GIT to sync and merge my work with the online
version stored on GITHUB. I am really happy that it finally works since this has really been something that has created a feeling
of failure and unsecurity, both for my self but also for the group since we all have had problems with this in the beginning.
Further, I think that my goal of having a more narrow scope of my personal tasks this week has been a success since even though we
had holidays and therefore lost some of the day and also have been working on the bacelor thesis, I think that I have mostly
met all my goals that I set in the beginning of the week. However, we have not been able to set the goals made by the group and this
was something we have to work with since we made a to broad scope for this weeks work but at least I was able to set a good goal
for my self that I managed to meet the criterias for and this is something I really enjoy.

For next week I want to improve my coding abilities in Java-Script and also learn how to add more functionality to the app than 
just basic ideas that I have had the pleasure to do up until now. This, I think I will be able to do by spending more time on the
project and the app when I am trying to solve some of the User-stories that I am responsible for.
Further, I will continue my work with the Scrum-concepts and I will be even better on using the and trying to get the group
to really use them. To be able to do this I will, as I have mentioned before, continue my studies of the course litterature and the 
video lessons about Scrum that I have found on Youtube.

Since this was a pretty bad week overall for the group with little time spent on creating value for the product owners and the end-users
, which mostly has been because of the lack of time for the project because of the holidays and the Bachelor thesis, it will be exciting
to see how this weeks work will carry on. I really hope that we have set better scope this week that isn't to broad and that
this will help us to really deliver something of real value for the customer. As a final reflection I think that it is
pretty good that our insecurities are decreasing and that we are really getting a better grip of the concepts and the work in
the group. It feels good!

WEEK 4

WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
Since last week, most of my time has been used for learning about the programming environment and trying to get the software necessary 
for developing the project running. 
Therefore, I have not had sufficient time to explore and learn more about the Scrum methodology and how to work agile. Thus, I will 
continue with this goal for next week. To be more precise, I have set a goal to finish reading the last chapeters in the ScrumXP and 
also to start looking at the other literature. 
Concrete goals will also be to understand the shipping business better and more specifically get a better grip about how the Vessel 
captain operates and his demands. This also very much linked to the groups objectives.
Further, I want improve my skills in Java Script, and since I didn’t meet my goals here from last week, I will continue to pursue 
this since I believe it is crucial to get a good grip about this early.


HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
Regarding how I can help someone else to learn something new I believe it is a little bit trickier this week to specify this 
since we have been stuck with getting the programming environment to work as I mentioned earlier. And therefore, we are pretty 
much at the same level. However, I will try to share my experience from the error-seeking process, both in the group but also 
to the other teams.

Next week, if I will succeed with my learning achievements, I will be able to share my new knowledges about Scrum and the agile 
working way. 

WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
Regarding my contribution to this weeks application of scrum has been pretty limited due to our problems with the software 
development environment. It has mainly been about doing our weekly sprint planning, our work with user-stories and our work with
the sprint and the backlog. When this week began, I though that we would achieve more this week regarding our work with Scrum
but due to the hassle we have experienced with the software development program we have unfortunately neglected this a bit. 
Even though this is something bad, I will draw the reflection to be a little bit more realistic on how broad scope can be each week. 


WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES? 
THAT MEANS THAT FOR THE PERSONAL LEARNING OBJECTIVE YOU WILL EACH WEEK WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED IN 
RELATION TO LAST WEEK'S AMBITION (TECHNOLOGIES, CONCEPTS AND  SKILLS LEARNT AS WELL AS HOW THIS WAS ACHIEVED),
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE FOR THE NEXT WEEK AND HOW TO MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN. 
ANT TO CONTRIBUTE WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT, AND ALSO TO SHARE MY IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SCRUM

This week, I have mainly contributed by trying to get mine and the groups software development environment to work. I am a little 
disappointed on my work this week since my programming environment still does not work correctly but I will try to get this to work 
this weekend, even though it is not optimal, my reflection is that this is necessary since I will cause trouble for the group otherwise.

Even though my contribution mostly has consisted of installing the software and trying to resolve the errors, I have also contributed 
to creating and refining our groups user-stories. On wedneday we meet the product owners and showed our user stories, even though 
the liked most of them they had some input for our future work that I will keep in my mind during the rest of the project. This 
feedback for the product owners was mainly about the fact that we had not negotiated with them before stating our user stories and 
how we wanted to achieve our product. This is something I now have understood is very important since we ourselves cannot decide 
this in the team. Further, they also told us that it is important to have a dialog with the end-user as well. 

For next week, I really want to be able to meet my goals regarding what I want to learn since I believe I have spent to much time 
neglecting this this week.
I will also have a goal that I will be able to deliver something useful within the app by learning how to modify the JavaScrips. 
To do this I will study a “beginners user-guide” which I have found and which I think would be a good start for me. Since I don’t 
want to repeat this week’s mistake regarding the scope of the weeks goals, I will keep the content a little bit narrower. 
Further, as I have mentioned I will continue with getting the software development environment to work(Git, NodeJs  and Expo) 
which I hopefully will to this weekend.

WEEK 3

WHAT DO I WANT TO LEARN OR UNDERSTAND BETTER?
    - For next week I wont to gain a better understanding of the programming interface and how this enviroment works.
    - As of now we have only focused on getting the applications(e.g. Android studio, Expo, Git) running but we have not tried to use
      use it for creating own material. Thus, we have only used it with given, old material
    - Further, I want to continue learn more about how to create better user-stories and how to use "the gut" to get a good grip of how
      these should be designed and how big the scope of them should be.
     - I also wan to learn more about Java-Script since I have not previous worked with this
     - My goal is also to read at least 3-5 chapters in the SCRUMXP since I think it is helpful in the learning process

HOW CAN I HELP SOMEONE ELSE, OR THE ENTIRE TEAM, TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW?
    - I have spent a lot of time understanding the programming environment since I have a genuine interest in this and think it is exciting.
    - Therefore, I have had the opportunity to help other members in the team to install it and how to configure the settings etc.
    
WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S APPLICATION OF SCRUM?
    - This week I have been the Scrum master and therefore my contribution has been to coordinate the work and to work as a middleman
      between my group and the other teams. Especially, it was interesting to participate in the Scrum of Scrums and learn more about
      this process.

WHAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE TEAM’S DELIVERIES? 
THAT MEANS THAT FOR THE PERSONAL LEARNING OBJECTIVE YOU WILL EACH WEEK WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED IN 
RELATION TO LAST WEEK'S AMBITION (TECHNOLOGIES, CONCEPTS AND  SKILLS LEARNT AS WELL AS HOW THIS WAS ACHIEVED),
WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE FOR THE NEXT WEEK AND HOW TO MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN. 
ANT TO CONTRIBUTE WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT, AND ALSO TO SHARE MY IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SCRUM
    - My contribution to the team's deliveries consists of, as mentioned earlier, help with the installation of the environment. Even
      though we have not succeedeed completely we have still had progress in the work and I think that our uncertainties will continue
      to decrease next week as we get more familiar with the applications and the scenario
    - Further, I have contributed with creating user-stories together with the other members
    - I have also helped the group indirectly by gaining a better understanding of SCRUM  and the scenario

    - For next week I plan to improve my knowledge of Java Script and also to get the programming fully functional. Further, I will
      continute my studies of the agile methodology and the SCRUM way. I will also be more prepared for the meetings and
      improve my knowledge in the marine business to better understand the end user, since I think this is crucial to get
      a good product.

Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to get a better understanding about what the product owner's demand and how this will affect the project
- Further, I need to continue my studies of SCRUM and the methodolody
- I also want to improve my knowledge about software quality and how this can be measured


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will spread my knowledge about SCRUM that I have gained at the LEGO exercise and the lectures and also since I have studied the book a lot
, I can share this knowledge to those who have not yet done that

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- My contribution this week will consit of learning more about SCRUM and the product owners demand, since I belive this is crucial for success later
in the project
- Since it is easter and I have been away my contribution this week will be a little bit lower than usual

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
- I have learnt more about SCRUM and i have improved my knowledge about agile development
- However, we have not yet get to know the group so good since many have been away but I belive this will be improved next week.

- Next week I want to contribute with a better understanding of the project, and also to share my improved knowledge about SCRUM
- Further, I will continue with the objective's set the first week.
- This will be done by studying the project and the SCRUM litterature, togheter with the group meetings.


As I have mentioned earlier, many have been away this week and the easter makes it hard to have a good flow with the project.
This will require the team to compensate for the lost work next week but I belive it is managable!

Week 1
What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to understand the SCRUM framework better and to learn more how this may help our development project. Furhter, I want to learn more about agile development.
- To be able to fully contribute to the development of the project I need to learn more about GITHUB and the different tools that are needed.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Right now, we have only developed very basic knowledge about the area and not any specific knowledge wherefore it is hard to distinguish how I can help other.
- However, I have will have an open mindset and try to help my team members the best way I can

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- This week my contribution will mainly consist of trying to understand scrum my self, since this is needed to contribute the application of scrum.
- Also, I have contributed by trying to encourage our team spirit and trying to set a good direction for the project early.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- My learning objective is to 
    - Gain a better understanding of the scrum framewoek
    - Improve my knowledge about agile development
    - Try to learn my working group better
    - Continously work with the development of the product
    
Since it is the first week of the project it is hard to set good and relevant objectives but I will 
update these continously when I have gotten a better understanding about what and how
to measure my performance.
