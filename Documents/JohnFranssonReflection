Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to get a better understanding about what the product owner's demand and how this will affect the project
- Further, I need to continue my studies of SCRUM and the methodolody
- I also want to improve my knowledge about software quality and how this can be measured


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will spread my knowledge about SCRUM that I have gained at the LEGO exercise and the lectures and also since I have studied the book a lot
, I can share this knowledge to those who have not yet done that

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- My contribution this week will consit of learning more about SCRUM and the product owners demand, since I belive this is crucial for success later
in the project
- Since it is easter and I have been away my contribution this week will be a little bit lower than usual

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
- I have learnt more about SCRUM and i have improved my knowledge about agile development
- However, we have not yet get to know the group so good since many have been away but I belive this will be improved next week.

- Next week I want to contribute with a better understanding of the project, and also to share my improved knowledge about SCRUM
- Further, I will continue with the objective's set the first week.
- This will be done by studying the project and the SCRUM litterature, togheter with the group meetings.


As I have mentioned earlier, many have been away this week and the easter makes it hard to have a good flow with the project.
This will require the team to compensate for the lost work next week but I belive it is managable!


Week 1
What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to understand the SCRUM framework better and to learn more how this may help our development project. Furhter, I want to learn more about agile development.
- To be able to fully contribute to the development of the project I need to learn more about GITHUB and the different tools that are needed.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Right now, we have only developed very basic knowledge about the area and not any specific knowledge wherefore it is hard to distinguish how I can help other.
- However, I have will have an open mindset and try to help my team members the best way I can

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- This week my contribution will mainly consist of trying to understand scrum my self, since this is needed to contribute the application of scrum.
- Also, I have contributed by trying to encourage our team spirit and trying to set a good direction for the project early.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- My learning objective is to 
    - Gain a better understanding of the scrum framewoek
    - Improve my knowledge about agile development
    - Try to learn my working group better
    - Continously work with the development of the product
    
Since it is the first week of the project it is hard to set good and relevant objectives but I will 
update these continously when I have gotten a better understanding about what and how
to measure my performance.
