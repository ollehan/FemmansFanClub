Week 1


What do I want to learn or understand better?
* Since the project-sprints hasn't officially started yet I would first and foremost like to learn more about working agile in the SCRUM-way.
* I am also inexperienced when it comes to working with github so I want to improve my knowledge in this area.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* So far the team seems to be on an even playing field, with everyone having pretty much the same background so there isn't much to learn from eachother yet.
* Through discussions with the team we have increased our collective knowledge in SCRUM.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
* I have contributed by helping with setting up our weekly preliminairy schedule and reading up on the ways of working in SCRUM in order to spread my knowledge to the team members.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition 
(technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change 
and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
* My learning objective of this week has, as mentioned above, to increase my knowledge in agile programming and in the ways of SCRUM. I have done this both through scrum-discussions with the group but also through reading up on the ways of working in scrum and attending the lectures.
* I am also planning on increasing my knowledge working in github, and understanding the platform better in order to maximize our workflow. 
* We haven't started with the official project yet, but next week my ambition is to understand the main project objectives and make necessary preparations for our first official sprint.


Week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I want to improve on areas similair to last week - learning how to work in an agile way with SCRUM. I have already 
  read up on SCRUM quite a lot last week, and also participated on the excercises regarding SCRUM, but I still feel like there
  is more to learn. This will be done by reading up on the areas and having joint discussions with the group.
  * Improve my knowledge regarding the shipping business and the existing application we are going to work with.
  * Once again continuing on areas mentioned last week - improving my knowledge working in GitHub. This will be done by rewatching 
  the GitHub tutorials.
  
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 * As mentioned last week - everyone on the team is pretty much on an even playing field when it comes to programming,
 and since we haven't officially started the project yet there isn't much I can teach in that regard.
 * I can however help my team with working in GitHub a bit more, since I feel like my knowledge has improved that department.
 For instanced how commit changes works, or what the different branches is.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
  * As mentioned above, I have read up on the concept of SCRUM and participated in the different excercises.
  * The first official sprint starts next week, in which I will be able to contribute more towards the team's application of 
  SCRUM.
  * I have been abroad together some of the other team members, so the members of the homefront have tried to inform us to 
  the best of their ability. We will make up for this next week, most likely exceeding 20h.

The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change 
and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
  * As mentioned a couple of times above, the project hasn't officially started which makes it hard for to describe an objective for the week.
  With that said the objective for this week was:
    * Understanding SCRUM and how to work with it well enough, so that we will be ready for our first sprint - Was done through
    reading up on the project.
    * Understanding the project background well enough to be prepared for the first sprint - was done through 
    reading up on the project background and discussing with our team members on the homefront.
  Next weeks objective is:
    * Completing our first official sprint in a successfull way, or at least in a way in which we learn from potential mistakes.
    This will be done mainly through trying to apply the knowledge I have gained from reading up on SCRUM and agile programming
    so far.
