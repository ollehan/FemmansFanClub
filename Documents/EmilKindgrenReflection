Individual Reflection Week 1:
*Since it is the first week of the course and we have not gotten so much information about the objectives of the software-project 
itself, i would like this weeks reflection to focus on the areas we have touched upon so far. 

What do I want to learn or understand better?
The main subject i am excited to learn more about is how to work effectively with the SCRUM-method and how it can be applied to a project of this size. 
I am not used to work in groups this big and i am intressted in finding out how SCRUM can help with the responsibilities and roles in the group and see if it helps our group work more agile.
Usely i am not a person who reflects to much and like to focus forward, as i have come to understand a big part of Scrum is to reflect and learn from that which means i most likely will learn alot in this area. 
I have seen GitHub and other repository sites but nevery worked with one myself. It will therefor be intresting to see how GitHub can help and make the future work easier and more organized. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the project just started we have not met so many hurdles yet. We all have pretty basic knowledge of Scrum and are on the same level of programing knowledge. 
Furhter as the weeks progresses tho i feel like we will develop different skillsets and i will always strive to share my newfound knowledge any way possible, this will help us work more effeciently.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
So far it is at a very early stage of the project and i have no previous experience of Scrum. This weeks main focus has therefor been to really getting into the concept of scrum. This has been done by attending the lecutres and also some litterature. 
I feel like we all are at the same knowledge level here and that we can help each others with some reminders and discusstions around the subject to get a more united view on how we will apply it to our day to day work in the project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

As i have mentioned above i feel like i have started to get some theoretical knowledge of what scrum is and how it works. To evolve this even more i would like to get insight of how the scrum framework helps our team work in a more agile way. Both theoretical but also practical if possible during next weeks sprint. 


Individual Reflection Week 2:

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more how the SCRUM methodology and reflective approach works when we work in a more programming enviroenment and not only gathering information and knowledge. 
I feel like i have started to get a hang of GitHUB but we have came across som prblems with the forks of the repository which we need to solve to next week,
.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
So far it is at a very early stage of the project and i have no previous experience of Scrum. This weeks main focus has therefor been to get a first understanding of how the project and scenario is. This has been done by attending the lecutres. 
I feel like we all are at the same knowledge level here and that we can help each others with some reminders and discusstions around the subject to get a more united view on how we will apply it to our day to day work in the project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Last week we read much and got ourself into the world of SCRUM. Now i am excited to see how we as a group will apply this when we start to program. 
Until next week i want to learn more how GITHUB works with it's forks and different branches since we just now have realised we got some problems about that,
I will also read more about the project and scenario itself to get more insight for next sprint. this will help the group set good and reachable sprints for net week.


Individual Reflection Week 3:

 - What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get a better understanding of how the setup of the programming environment is connected and how it all links together to help us as developers in our day to day work.
I want to get more knowledge on the portableCDM apps code to see where we as a team can make improvements for our actor, the vessel
I want to get more experience of writing user stories to contribute to our backlog in a more efficient way.

 - How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By getting a better insight of how the environment is connected and how the backlog will work with user stories that breaks into smaller pieces etc.
When this is done i can share my knowledge with the rest of the group and discuss what we believe is the most efficient way to work here on forward. 

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have getting good insight of the scenario itself which as i believe is the backbone of the project. From this i have helped the team to write user stories that is essential for the backlog methodology.

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
 - That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
 - relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
 - what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

 - It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
 - evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
This week i have spent much time getting good knowledge of the scenario and information about the project and app itself. This has helped the team when we wrote our first user stories.
I have also got myself some more knowledge of how github works and tried to get the whole programming environment up and running. Unfortonutley i still have some problems with permissions when i try to globally install npm. This needs to be fixed until next week.


Individual Reflection week 4:

 - What do I want to learn or understand better?
Jag har nu fått hela programmeringsmijön att fungera och börjat sätta mig in i koden. Det jag vill utveckla mycket denna vecka är hur koden är uppbyggd, vilka filer som jobbar ihop osv.
jag känner att scrum-metodiken börjar sitta men jag vill denna vecka känna att jag/gruppen riktigt bra lyckas jobba enligt product backlog med våra user stories osv.
När jag dessutom lyckats bidra med lite kod så vill jag lära mig exakt hur det fungerar att pusha kod via Git och gitignore osv. Denna biten är fortfarande lite oklar då vi helt enkelt inte behövt göra detta än pga ingen relevant kod skrivits.

 - How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Jag försöker sätta mig in i koden och när jag hittar något eller lär mig något som jag tror alla i gruppen kan ha nytta av är det vikgit att jag delar med mig av detta till alla för att vi inte ska behöva uppfinna hjulet på nytt varje gång.

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Det känns som jag, visserligen tillsammans med många andra i gruppen, börjar få relativt bra koll på hur Scrum-upplägget fungerar och vad som krävs av oss som medlemmar. Vi har ändrat en del i vårat upplägg och här känner jag att jag kunde vara med på ett bra sätt att ta fram det nya ramverket vi tog fram denna vecka med hur vi omformulerade de gamla user storiesarna osv.

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
 - That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
 - relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
 - what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
 - The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
 - It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
 - evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
I enligthet med tidigare skrivna mål har jag denna vecka lyckats förstå hur programmeringsmiljön fungerar. Detta har vi alla i gruppen hjälps åt med och bidragit till.
Nästa vecka skulle jag vilja sätta mig in mycket bättre i koden vilket jag tror skulle gynna gruppen på det sättet att vi kan koppla user storiesarna mer till koden som finns och vad som behöver utvecklas i vardera stories. 

Individual  week 5:

 - What do I want to learn or understand better?
Det är svårt att sätta sig och försöka bena ut filerna och hur de hänger ihop vilket gjort att detta behöver läggas mer tid på. Har absolut börjat hitta lite grejer och fått skapat nya flikar, lagt in lite "dumma" funktioner på vissa sidor osv men finns en hel del kvar att lära här!

 - How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Precis som förra veckan tycker jag det fungerar bra Reflectionatt alla delar med sig av sin nyfunna kunskap, här vill jag också fortsätta bidra på samma sätt.

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Jag har hjälpt till att strukturera om våra user stories rejält och hur vi ska jobba med trello för att på ett effektivt sätt kunna arbeta parallellt. 

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
 - That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in

Denna vecka har jag fått git pch push/pull att fungera vilket gjort hela programmeringsmiljön redo. Jag har även satt mig in i koden en hel del genom att jobba med user stories och därigenom "tvingats" försöka var kreativ och hittat lösningar. Här känner jag jag behöver mer tid för att helt kunna lösa storien. 


Individual  week 5:

 - What do I want to learn or understand better?
Den här veckan har jag tyvärr inte kunnat bidra så mycket till kodandet. Jag satt ihop med rebecca till en början av sprinten vilket gjorde att vi kom en bit framåt i hur appen fungerar men tyvärr inte i närheten av tillräckligt bra mot vad jag vill, här måste bättring ske i slutet av nästa sprint då jag har avsatt mycket tid för detta arbete.

 - How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Denna veckan har varit lite speciell pga bortrest, jag har därför försökt bidra så mycket jag kunant genom att hjälpa till med allmänna grejer som team reflection och vidragit med mina tankar och idéer på frågor vi innan inte har tagit tag i ännu, detta var dock lite svårt då man itne var fysiskt närvarande och här måste det blir bättring till nästa vecka när det är mer tillbaks till det normala.

 - What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Se ovan.

Precis som ovan så har min delivery denna veckan varit i huvudsak kring allmänna uppgifter som team reflection osv. Till nästa vecka måste jag bli mer insatt i sprinten, när jag kommer hem från resan måste jag fråga folk vad som gjorts, vad som behövs göras till onsdagen osv för att på så sätt ändå skapa så mycket värde som möjligt från min sida.
